#### Git
1. [Learning Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org)
    - This is a fantastic way to learn about Git branching because of the physical interaction. The site lets you visualize exactly how your commands are affecting the project.
    - The interactivity of the project is what helped it work for me. It is a lot easier to understand something when you're able to actually use it and see the effects.
    - For complete beginners it might be difficult to translate the lessons from this site directly to a real project, especially one where you are collaborating with other people.
