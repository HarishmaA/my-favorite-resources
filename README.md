#### Git
1. [Git No Shit](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
    - Extremely beginner friendly. 
    - Gives the necessary commands that you need to learn to get started and doesn't make you get overwhelemd
    - Beginers often stop with this resource alone hence struggle when real problems hit which is why I suggest the next resource
    
2. [Learn Git not commands](https://dev.to/unseenwizzard/learn-git-concepts-not-commands-4gjc)
    - Yes, commands are important to work with but learning the under the hood concepts is largely important. 
    - The article explains it farely simply and easy to consume manner. 
    - Nothing specific

#### Git
1. [Learning Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org)
    - This is a fantastic way to learn about Git branching because of the physical interaction. The site lets you visualize exactly how your commands are affecting the project.
    - The interactivity of the project is what helped it work for me. It is a lot easier to understand something when you're able to actually use it and see the effects.
    - For complete beginners it might be difficult to translate the lessons from this site directly to a real project, especially one where you are collaborating with other people.

#### UDACITY
1. [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)
    - The video are short and the instructors explain the concepts very clearly with real world examples
    - I learnt Java Programming, Javascript from Udacity. The quizzes are really helpful to understand the concepts better.
    - Sometimes,it will be little difficult to clear the quizzes. Anyway, the answers will be provided.
